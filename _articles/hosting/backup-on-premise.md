With the public cloud version of Bitwarden, we automatically handle backing up your data for you. However, when self-hosting Bitwarden you must implement your own backup procedures in order to keep your data safe.

Bitwarden's Docker containers use volume mapping to keep all important data persisted on the host machine. You can find this data in the `./bwdata` directory relative to your Bitwarden installation. The Docker containers themselves are to be considered ephemeral and do not persist data or state.

You should back up and keep the entire `./bwdata` directory safe. In the event of data loss you will need all or parts of data contained in this directory to restore your installation.

Some particularly important parts of the `./bwdata` directory are:

- `./bwdata/mssql/data` - database data
- `./bwdata/core/attachments` - vault item attachments
- `./bwdata/env` - environment variables, including database and certificate passwords

## Nightly database backups

Bitwarden will automatically take nightly backups of the `mssql` container database. These database backups are kept in the `./bwdata/mssql/backups` directory. Nightly database backups are kept in this directory for 30 days. In the event of data loss, you can restore one of these daily backups. 

### Restoring a nightly backup

1. First log into `bitwarden-mssql` container. In order to log into the container you will first need to figure out the container ID.

       docker ps

2. Note the container ID, and execute an interactive bash shell on the `bitwarden-mssql` container.

       docker exec -it bitwarden-mssql /bin/bash

3. Take note of the backup file you wish to restore in the nightly backups directory. The backups directory is mapped from a host volume at `./bwdata/mssql/backups` to `/etc/bitwarden/mssql/backups` within the `bitwarden-mssql` container.

       ls /etc/bitwarden/mssql/backups

    For this example, the backup we will be using is named `vault_FULL_20200302_235901.BAK`, which is a backup of the vault database on March 2, 2020 at 11:53pm. The full path of the backup in the container would be `/etc/bitwarden/mssql/backups/vault_FULL_20200302_235901.BAK`

4. Execute `sqlcmd` with the required authentication. Please note that you will want to get the database sa password from the `./bwdata/env/global.override.env` file on your host.

       /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P ${SA_PASSWORD}

5. Execute the SQL command `RESTORE DATABASE` with your backup to restore the nightly backup, followed by a `GO` command.

       RESTORE DATABASE vault FROM DISK = '/etc/bitwarden/mssql/backups/vault_FULL_20200302_235901.BAK' WITH REPLACE
       GO

Your Bitwarden database should now be restored.
