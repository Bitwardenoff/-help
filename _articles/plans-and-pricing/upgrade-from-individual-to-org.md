3. On the New Organization screen, enter an **Organization Name** for your new Organization and the **Billing Email** we can reach you at.

   {% endnote %}

4. If you're creating an Organization on behalf of a business:
   - Check the **This account is owned by a business** checkbox.
   - Provide your **Business Name**.

5. In the **Choose Your Plan** section, select which type of Organization to create. Options include:
   - **Free:** For testing or personal users to share with 1 other user. **[Learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#free-organizations/)**.
   - **Families:** For personal use, to share with family & friends. **[Learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#families-organizations/)**.

   - **Enterprise:** For businesses and other large organizations. **[Learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#enterprise-organizations/)**.

   {% note %}Paid Organizations (Families, Teams, or Enterprise) include **Premium** features for all enrolled users. For more information about Premium features, see [About Bitwarden Plans](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#compare-the-plans/).
   {% endnote %}

6. Enter the following information:
   - If you selected **Teams** or **Enterprise**, enter the number of Bitwarden **User Seats** you need. You can add additional seats later if required.
   - If you selected **Families**, **Teams**, or **Enterprise**, enter the amount of **Additional Storage (GB)** you need. Your plan comes with 1 GB of shared encrypted file storage, and you can add additional storage later if needed.
7. In the **Summary** section, select whether you'd like to be billed **Annually** or **Monthly**.
8. Enter your **Payment Information** and select **Submit**.

## Cancel Individual Premium

Paid Organizations (Families, Teams, or Enterprise) automatically provide all users with access to premium features. If you had a **Premium** individual subscription at the time of creating the Organization, you can cancel your **Premium** individual subscription without losing access to premium features.

{% warning %}
If you cancel your **Premium** individual subscription, leaving the Paid Organization will result in a loss of access to premium features.
{% endwarning %}

Complete the following steps to cancel your **Premium** individual subscription:

1. Log in to your [Web Vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com/).
2. Open the **Settings** tab and select **Premium Membership** from the left menu.
3. Select the **Cancel Subscription** button.
