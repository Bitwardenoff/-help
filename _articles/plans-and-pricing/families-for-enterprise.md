Members of [Enterprise Organizations]({{site.baseurl}}/article/about-organizations/#types-of-organizations) are offered a **free Families Organization** sponsorship that can be applied to a new or pre-existing Families Organization and redeemed directly from the Web Vault.

Using a **Families Organization**, you can securely share Vault data between yourself and up to 5 friends or family members. Families Organizations include premium Bitwarden features for all 6 users, including [advanced Two-step Login methods]({{site.baseurl}}/article/setup-two-step-login), [encrypted file attachments]({{site.baseurl}}/article/attachments), [Emergency Access]({{site.baseurl}}/article/emergency-access/), and [more]({{site.baseurl}}/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#compare-the-plans).

## Redeem your Sponsorship

To redeem your sponsorship:

1. Log in to the Bitwarden account attached to the sponsoring Organization.
2. Navigate to **Settings** &rarr; **Free Bitwarden Families**:

3. On this screen, provide a **personal email** you want to redeem the sponsorship with and select **Redeem**:

4. In your inbox, you'll get an email from Bitwarden inviting you to accept the sponsorship:

5. If there is a Bitwarden account associated with the provided **personal email**, log in. If there is not an account associated with the personal email, you'll be directed to the Create Account screen.
6. Once you've logged in, you'll be directed to a screen where you can finish redeeming your sponsorship for a **New Families Organization** or an **Existing Families Organization**:
