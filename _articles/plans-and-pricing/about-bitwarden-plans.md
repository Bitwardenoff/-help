## Bitwarden For You

Bitwarden For You plans are designed to give you or your family all the tools needed to securely manage data:

### Free Individual

We believe everyone should have access to password security tools. The core features of Bitwarden are 100% free, including unlimited storage of Logins, Notes, Cards, and Identities, access to Bitwarden on any device, a Secure Password Generator, and more. Signup **[for free](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/register/)**.

### Premium Individual

Upgrade your personal Bitwarden account to unlock premium password security and management features, including advanced 2FA options, the Bitwarden Authenticator (TOTP), encrypted file storage, and more. Upgrade **[now](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/?premium=purchase)**.

{% note %}
Premium does not include secure data sharing. In order to access sharing features, you will need a subscription to an Organization ([Free](#free-organizations), [Families](#families-organizations), [Teams](#teams-organizations), or [Enterprise](#enterprise-organizations)). Paid Organizations ([Families](#families-organizations), [Teams](#teams-organizations), or [Enterprise](#enterprise-organizations)) include Premium features for all individual users that are enrolled in that Organization.
{% endnote %}

### Families Organizations

Start a Families Organization to share private data between you and 5 friends or family members. Families Organizations include all premium features for all 6 users and unlimited secure data sharing within the Families Organization.
