Or, to learn more about the Bitwarden Enterprise offering, see [Bitwarden Plans and Pricing](https://bitwarden.com/pricing/business) or [About Bitwarden Plans]({{site.baseurl}}/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#enterprise-organizations).

## Already a User?

If you already have a Bitwarden account, complete the following steps to start your 7 Day Free Trial of Bitwarden Enterprise:

1. Log in to your [Web Vault]({{site.baseurl}}/article/getting-started-webvault).
2. Select the **New Organization** button.

3. On the **New Organization** screen, enter an **Organization Name** for your new Organization and the **Billing Email** we can reach you at.

   {% callout info %}We won't charge you until your 7 Day Free Trial of the Enterprise Plan is over. You can cancel your subscription at any time in the **Settings** tab of your Organization.
   {% endcallout %}

4. If you're trialing the Enterprise Plan on behalf of a business:
   - Check the **This account is owned by a business** checkbox.
   - Provide your **Business Name**.
5. Select the **Enterprise** plan option. Doing so will trigger additional enterprise-oriented fields to be displayed.
6. In the **Users** section, enter the number of **User Seats** you need. Seats will be added if you exceed this number, unless you [specify a limit]({{site.baseurl}}/article/managing-users/#set-a-seat-limit).
7. In the **Addons** section, enter the amount of **Additional Storage (GB)** you need. Your plan comes with 1 GB of shared encrypted file attachments, and you can add additional storage later if required.
8. In the **Summary** section, select whether you'd like to be billed **Annually** or **Monthly**.
9. Enter your **Payment Information** and select **Submit**.
