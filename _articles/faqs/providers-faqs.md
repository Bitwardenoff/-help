### Q: How does pricing for Providers work?

**A:** Participating in the Provider Program is free! As a Provider, you'll only be billed for the Client Organizations that you create and/or administer.

### Q: How are Client Organizations billed?

**A:** Currently, each Client Organization is billed separately using the payment method registered during [Client Organization creation]({{site.baseurl}}/article/client-org-setup/). In the future, we'll be developing functionality to aggregate billing across Client Organizations to improve the Provider experience.
