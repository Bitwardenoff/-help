### Q: Can I add an existing Organizations to my Provider?

**A:** Yes! MSPs, Resellers, and other Bitwarden Partners that are already administering Organizations on behalf of their clients can add pre-existing Organizations to their Provider Portal.

When Bitwarden detects that a [Provider Admin's]({{site.baseurl}}/article/provider-users/#provider-user-types) account is the **Owner of a non-Provider Organization**, the Provider Portal will display an **Add existing organization** button:

Selecting the **Add existing organization** button prompts you to select the Organization to add to the Provider:

Once added, the Organization will appear in the {% icon fa-bank %} **Clients** list alongside all other Client Organizations.

### Q: How does pricing for Providers work?

**A:**

### Pricing for Partners

Whether you’re reselling or using Bitwarden on behalf of clients, Bitwarden offers a transparent pricing model. Price is based on per user per month, and is not dependent on the deployment method (cloud, private cloud, or self-host). Volume discounts start at 250 seats.

### Invoicing

Bitwarden will invoice based on Organization Seats for yearly subscriptions and an invoice will be sent to the Billing Contact on your Account. With many of our MSPs, they add on or charge for additional services, so they prefer to handle billing their own clients.

### Value-Added Services

Partners have complete flexibility for how they want to structure additional services for Clients. Some examples of services are organization consulting and implementation, onboarding training, Collections management, Support, and Reporting. If you’d like to see an example of how to structure an invoice for your client, [contact us](https://bitwarden.com/contact/).
