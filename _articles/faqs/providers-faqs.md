### Q: How does pricing for Providers work?

**A:** Participating in the Provider Program is free! As a Provider, you'll only be billed for the Client Organizations that you create and/or administer.

### Q: How are Client Organizations billed?

**A:** Currently, each Client Organization is billed separately using the payment method registered during [Client Organization creation]({{site.baseurl}}/article/client-org-setup/). In the future, we'll be developing functionality to aggregate billing across Client Organizations to improve the Provider experience.

### Q: How many clients can I manage through the Provider Portal?

**A:** There is no limit to the number of Client Organizations that can be managed within the Provider Portal.

### Q: Is the Provider Portal available for self-hosted environments?

**A:** Not at this time.

### Q:What happens if I am locked out of my Provider Admin account?

**A:** Access to the Provider Portal is through your Bitwarden account. If you forget your Master Password, Bitwarden has no knowledge of, way to retrieve, or way to reset your Master Password and you will be unable to access the Provider Portal. **Bitwarden strongly recommends that you provision a second user with a Provider Admin role for failover purposes.**
