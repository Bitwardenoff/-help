## What is Two-Step Login?

Two-step Login (also called *Two-factor Authentication* or *2FA*) is an increasingly common security technique used by websites and apps to protect your sensitive data. Websites that use Two-Step Login will require you to verify their identity by entering an additional "token" (also called *Verification Code* or *One-time Password (OTP*)) besides Username and Password, typically retrieved from a different device.

Without physical access to the token from your **Secondary Device**, a malicious actor would be unable to access the Website, even if they discover your Username and Password:

Commonly, websites or apps with sensitive data (for example, your online bank account) will attempt verify your identity outside of the login screen by:

- Sending a token in an SMS / Text message to the mobile device on-file.
- Asking for a token generated by an Authenticator app (for example, Authy) on your mobile device.
- Looking for a token from a physical security key (for example, Yubikey).

### How should I use Two-step Login?

Security often involves a tradeoff between protection and convenience, so ultimately it's up to you! Generally, the two most critical ways to use Two-step Login are:

1. [**To Secure Bitwarden**](#securing-bitwarden)

   Bitwarden support a variety of Two-step Login methods that you can use to secure Vault data. Enabling Two-step Login will require you to complete a secondary step each time you **Log In**, in addition to entering your Master Password.
2. [To Secure Important Websites]

## Securing Bitwarden

Since your Password Manager stores all your logins, we highly recommend that you secure it with Two-step Login. Doing so protects *all* your logins by preventing a malicious actor from accessing your Vault, even if they discover your Master Password.

Enabling Two-step Login will require you to complete a secondary step each time you **Log In**, in addition to entering your Master Password.

**Bitwarden offers several Two-step Login methods for free,** including:

- via an Authenticator app (for example, Authy or Google Authenticator)
- via Email

**For Premium users**, Bitwarden offers several advanced Two-step Login methods:

- Duo Security with Duo Push, SMS, phone call, and U2F security keys
- YubiKey (any 4/5 series device or YubiKey NEO/NFC)
- FIDO U2F (any FIDO U2F certified key)

To learn more about your options, and for help setting up any method, see [Two-step Login Methods]({% link _articles/two-step-login/setup-two-step-login.md %}).

You can enable any number of methods you'd like, for more information see [Using Multiple Two-step Login Methods]({% link _articles/two-step-login/setup-two-step-login.md %}).

## Securing Important Websites

Bitwarden probably isn't the only website or app you use that has Two-step Login options, which is especially useful for websites that store sensitive information (for example, Credit Card or Bank Account numbers). Most websites with a Two-step Login option will locate it in the **Settings**, **Security**, or **Privacy** menus.

Activating Two-step Login will typically open a QR code, like this one from Reddit:

{% image two-step/field-guide/reddit-2fa-setup.png %}

Scanning this code with an authenticator app, like [Authy](https://authy.com/){:target="_blank"}, will enable the app to generate rotating 6-digit tokens you can use to verify your identity.

### Use Authy

To setup Two-step Login for Reddit using Authy, tap the **Add Account** button and scan the QR code presented by your website or app. Scanning the QR code will generate a 6-digit token, like this one:

{% image two-step/field-guide/reddit-token.png %}

Enter this code in the Verification Code input box to finish setting up Two-step Login with Authy. Typically, you will be given the option to download **Recovery Codes**. Downloading Recovery Codes is critical to prevent you from losing access to your Two-step Login tokens, even if you lose the device Authy is installed on.

Next time you login to Reddit, you'll be required to verify your identity by entering a Verification Code from Authy. Verification Codes rotate every 30 seconds, so it will be impossible for a malicious actor to discover your code without physical access to your device.

{% callout info %}
Authy is Bitwarden's recommended authenticator app because it includes Authenticator Backups for any device. Backups prevent you from losing access to your Two-step Login tokens, even if you lose the device Authy is installed on. Flip the **Authenticator Backups** toggle on the **Accounts** screen of the Authy app to use this feature.

Other authenticator apps include [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en){:target="_blank"} and [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/){:target="_blank"}), and *as of May 7, 2020 Google Authenticator includes Verification Code portability across Android devices.*
{% endcallout %}

### Use Bitwarden Authenticator

**As an alternative to Authy,** Bitwarden offers a built-in authenticator for Premium users, including members of Paid Organizations (Families, Teams, or Enterprise).

Bitwarden for iOS and Android can scan QR codes and generate 6-digit tokens just like other authenticator apps. Using Bitwarden Authenticator to secure a website will save a rotating 6-digit token with that login Vault item.

For more help setting up and using the Bitwarden Authenticator, see [Bitwarden Authenticator]({% link _articles/features/authenticator-keys.md %}).

#### Why Use Bitwarden Authenticator?

Understandably, some users are skeptical about using Bitwarden for token authentication. Remember, security often involves a tradeoff between protection and convenience, so the best solution is up to you. Generally, folks that use Bitwarden Authenticator do so for two reasons:

1. **Convenience**

   ???
2. **Sharing**

   For Organizations, a large benefit of using Bitwarden Authenticator for token verification is the ability to share the token generation among team members. This allows Organizations to protect their accounts with Two-step Login without sacrificing the ability for multiple users to access that account or requiring coordination between two employees to share tokens in an unsafe way.

### CUT LINE















#### Bitwarden mobile app and QR code scan


Select the login for Reddit in your Bitwarden Vault, then Edit, then use the camera icon next to the item Authenticator Key (TOTP) to scan the Reddit-presented QR code.

Once you save the item, you now have an entry within your Reddit Login in Bitwarden for Verification Code (TOTP). This is the 6 digit number Reddit needs to complete the two-factor authentication setup.

#### Bitwarden browser extension and manual Authentication key

Directly within the browser extension, you can manually add an Authentication Key to enable two-step login.

When Reddit displays the dialogue with the barcode, it offers two options:

> Step 2: Use your authenticator app to scan the barcode below or **get a token to enter manually instead**.

You can click ‘get a token to enter manually instead’ to copy the long string of numbers and digits.

Within your browser extension, you can view and edit the Reddit Login, and manually enter the Authenticator Key (TOTP).

- Click the checkmark
- Save the item
- Hit the copy icon next to the Verification Code (TOTP)
- Paste that into the Reddit dialogue

### Using Keyboard Shortcuts with Two-step Login

Once you have your Verification Code within your Reddit login, you can use keyboard shortcuts to smooth the login process.

When you approach the Reddit Login dialogue, use Windows:`Ctrl + Shift + L` or macOS: `Cmd + Shift + L` to enter your username and password. Following that, the Verification Code (TOTP) is automatically added to your clipboard. Use Windows: `Ctrl + V` or macOS: `Cmd + V` to paste it in!

While one can debate whether this process has a different security profile compared to sending a code to a separate physical device, it does offer more protection while also being fast and convenient.


## Stay safe with Two-step Login

Whichever path you choose, remember the basics

- Use two-step login for your password manager
- Use two-step login for your critical website logins - With a 3rd party app like Authy or FreeOTP; or - Within your password manager such as Bitwarden
