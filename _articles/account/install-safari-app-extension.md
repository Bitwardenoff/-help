The new Safari App Extension is now packaged with the Bitwarden Desktop App. This is the recommended development path from Apple for Safari App Extensions.


Download the Bitwarden Safari App Extension (within the Bitwarden Desktop App)
[https://vault.bitwarden.com/download/?app=desktop&platform=macos](https://vault.bitwarden.com/download/?app=desktop&platform=macos)

You can also use the App Store version of the Bitwarden Desktop App.

Be sure to run the desktop application once. If the extension still does not appear, it may just need to be enabled. In Safari, check under Preferences > Extensions.
