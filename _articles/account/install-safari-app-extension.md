## Get the Extension

Bitwarden's Safari App Extension is packaged with the Bitwarden Desktop App available on the App Store, as recommended by from Apple regarding Safari App Extensions.

{% callout warning %}
Due to changes by Apple, Safari now limits Safari App Extension use to only those obtained through Mac App Store downloads. As of Q1 2021, users will not be able to use a Bitwarden Safari App Extension obtained through a `.dmg` installation from [bitwarden.com/download](https://bitwarden.com/download){:target="\_blank"} or any other non-App Store source.

To read community conversation on the topic, refer to the following Apple Developer Forum threads ([Thread #1](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/659029){:target="\_blank"}, [Thread #2](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/667859){:target="\_blank"}).
