Deleting your Bitwarden account or Organization permanently deletes the account or Organization and **all data that is associated with it**. Bitwarden does not "soft delete" any data.

Deleting an account or Organization does not automatically cancel your subscription. If you're leaving Bitwarden, you should cancel your subscription from the **Settings** &rarr; **Premium Membership** or **Organization Settings** &rarr; **Subcription** page first.

If you're locked out of your Vault and deleting your account so that you can create a new one, [Contact Us](https://bitwarden.com/contact/){:target="\_blank"} and we can help transfer your subcription to the new account.

## Delete your Personal Account

### From the Web Vault

1. In the [Web Vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com){:target="\_blank"}, select **Settings** from the top navigation bar.
3. On the **My Account** page, scroll down to the **Danger Zone** and select the **Delete Account**.

   You'll be prompted to enter your Master Password to confirm you have the authority to take this action.

### Without Logging In

In the event that you have lost your Master Password, complete the following steps to delete your account:

1. Navigate to [vault.bitwarden.com/#/recover-delete](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/recover-delete).
2. Enter the **Email Address** associated with your account.
3. In your email inbox, open the email to verify that you want to delete this Bitwarden account.

Once deleted, you're free to create a new Bitwarden account with that email address. If you delete a Bitwarden account that has a Premium subscription associated with it, [Contact Us](https://bitwarden.com/contact/){:target="\_blank"} and we'll reapply your existing subscription to the new account.
