## Choosing the Right Subscription Plan

In continuing our mission to empower individuals and organizations to store and share sensitive data easily and securely, we are upgrading features included in some Plans. Certain Plan pricing is being updated as well.

**For existing customers, your Plan and your pricing will not change--your existing Plan will continue as it is now. Further, there is no plan to change your Plan or your pricing. However, if you are interested in moving to a new Plan, you can choose to upgrade anytime.**

There are no changes to the **Bitwarden Free Account**, and **Bitwarden Premium Features**, which remain at $10/year. We believe password management for individuals can and should be free. We also believe advanced options for individuals should be affordable.

**Bitwarden Families** grows from 5 users to 6, and the price is lowered from $52/year (with Premium Features for everyone) to $40/year, which now automatically includes Premium features for everyone.

**Bitwarden Teams** gets upgraded with Premium Features for all users, as well as some administrative features such as event logs, user group configuration, API access, 2FA with Duo, and access to the Directory Connector. The updated Teams plan is $3 per user per month billed annually.

**Bitwarden Enterprise** now includes our new [Login with SSO](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/bitwarden-password-manager-login-with-sso/), as well as Enterprise Policies. The updated Enterprise plan is $5 per user per month billed annually.

## Family Plan now has Premium Features

Since we introduced the Families Plan, we’ve seen more users opting to add Premium Features to increase the security capabilities for family members. We chose to make Premium Features standard for all members of the Families Plan and lower the overall cost.

Premium Features include 1 GB of encrypted file storage, two-step authentication, Bitwarden Authenticator (TOTP), vault health reports, and priority customer support.

The Families Plan includes 6 user seats for $40/year and all members automatically get Bitwarden Premium Features.

## Teams Plan: Premium Features and more organizational features


Teams Plans get expanded Bitwarden access with more features for team members and each Team organization as a whole.

## Enterprise Plan: Take advantage of Login with SSO

The new Enterprise Plan brings significant value to users with the highly anticipated [Login with SSO](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/bitwarden-password-manager-login-with-sso/) capability.

Login with SSO increases the value of Bitwarden for enterprises by bringing advantages to administrators and end-users:

- Simplifies platform access for employees
- Standardizes logging in with work credentials
- Allows secure user onboarding and succession
- Leverages any existing multi-factor authentication

Login with SSO also gives you ultimate flexibility, integrating with any existing identity management solution that uses SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect. This feature is only available to organizations on the new Enterprise Plan, which is $5/user/month.

{% image /plans/enterprise.png Enterprise is now more powerful than ever, offering identity based SSO %}

As our roadmap expands, we expect more enterprise capabilities to reside within this plan beyond Login with SSO and Enterprise Policies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### FAQS about Changes to Existing Plans

**Q: If I want to stay on my current Plan, do I need to do anything?**

A: No, you do not need to do anything. Your plan will stay as-is until you take action to upgrade to the additional features.

**Q: I am an existing Premium user, will I be affected?**

A: No, individual premium pricing has not changed.

**Q: Are there any changes to my existing Enterprise Plan pricing?**

A: No, there will be no changes to your existing Enterprise Plan unless you choose to upgrade to include the new Enterprise Login with SSO feature when it becomes available.

**Q: I am a current Teams user with a base user group of 5. Can I maintain that when upgrading to the new plan?**

A: When released, the new Teams plan is billed per-user, so yes you can move that team size, but you would be billed according to the new Teams pricing. You may also choose to add more than 5 users on the new Teams plan. Be aware that the new Teams plan does not have a 5-user get started package, so all users are billed at $3/user/month based on annual pricing.

**Q: Will pricing changes automatically be reflected in my invoices?**

A: If you do not upgrade plans, there will be no changes. If you upgrade to one of the new plans, yes, changes will be reflected in future invoices.
