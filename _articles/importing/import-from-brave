Importing your data from Brave into Bitwarden is easy.

##Export passwords from Brave (Desktop)

1. Open Brave and enter `brave://settings/passwords` into the address bar and press enter. This will open a page with all your **Saved Passwords** for Brave.
2. Locate the **Export passwords** option at the top of the **Saved Passwords** list. It is hidden under the options icon (`...`) next to the **Saved Passwords** heading.
3. Click the **Export passwords** option in the options menu. You may be prompted to enter your computer's password for authorization.
4. You'll then be prompted to save your passwords to a [CSV][csv] file on your computer. Save this file to your desktop as `brave_passwords.csv` (or whatever name you want to call it).

##Import your passwords into Bitwarden

1. Go to the [Bitwarden web vault][bitwarden-vault] and log in.
2. Navigate to **Tools** &rarr; **Import Data**.
3. Select **Brave (csv)** as the file format and select your `brave_passwords.csv` file from the desktop that you created in step 7 above.
4. Click the **Import Data** button.

Congratulations! You have just transferred all of your data from Brave into Bitwarden.
