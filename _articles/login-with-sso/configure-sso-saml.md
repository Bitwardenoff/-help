## Key Terms and Definitions

- SP - Service Provider, this is your Bitwarden instance

- IdP - Identity Provider, this is your identity server, provider, or federated identity service.

- Name ID - This is a value provided by the IdP that identifies the user claim represented by the assertion; a Name ID may be transient (different every time) or persistent (the same every time).

- Authn Request - A request created by the SP and sent to the IdP to initiate the authentication.

- Assertion - A response to the Authn Request from the IdP to the SP that contains any number of claims and attributes for use by the SP in return.

- Entity ID - This is a unique identifier, commonly a URL, and also commonly = to the base URI for each SP and IdPs respective service endpoints (but not necessarily, it could be any string).

- Signing - This is a digital signature created using a partyâ€™s private signing certificate and then verified by the relaying party using the source public key.
