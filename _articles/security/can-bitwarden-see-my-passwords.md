No.

Since your data is fully encrypted and/or hashed before ever leaving **your** local device, noone from the bitwarden
team can ever see, read, or reverse engineer to get to your real data. bitwarden servers only store encypted and hashed
data. This is an important step that bitwarden takes to protect you.

You can read more about how your data is encrypted and trasmitted [here][whatencryption].
