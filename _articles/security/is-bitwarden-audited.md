Yes.

By making 100% of our source code available under an open source GPLv3 license, our goal is to be as transparent as possible about how Bitwarden works and how it handles your sensitive data. Being open source also allows thousands of developers to quickly identify potential issues and to verify the quality of our solutions. However, we also understand the need for reputable, independent third-party experts to officially audit the Bitwarden codebase.

In October 2018, Bitwarden successfully completed a source code audit and cryptographic analysis by security firm [Cure53](https://cure53.de/). You can read more about this security audit [here](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/third-party-security-audit).

In July 2020, Bitarden successfully completed a thorough security assessment and penetration test by auditing firm [Insight Risk Consulting](https://www.insightriskconsulting.com/). You can read more about this security audit [here](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/bitwarden-network-security-assessment-2020/).

In August 2020, Bitwarden achieved SOC 2 Type 2 and SOC 3 certification. You learn more about this [here](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/bitwarden-achieves-soc-2-certification/)

Bitwarden also interacts with independent security researchers through our public bug bounty program on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/bitwarden/).
