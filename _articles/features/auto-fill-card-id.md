Bitwarden can autofill more than just your usernames and passwords! It can make online purchases and account creations a breeze. If you're unfamiliar with what these item types are, refer to our [Managing Items][manging-items-doc]article.

{% note %}The Bitwarden web browser extension is currently the only client capable of autofilling these types of items.{% endnote %}

## Autofill an Identity

From a page that you wish to autofill, open the browser extension and find your Identity under the "Identities" section.
