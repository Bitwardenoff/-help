Favorites allow you to quickly access your most used items. Any item can be designated as a Favorite. 

This includes items that have been shared with you from an Organization. Marking an Organization item as a Favorite will only pertain to your individual vault. It will not make the item a Favorite for all users of the Organization that it belongs to.
