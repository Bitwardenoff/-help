You can use the Bitwarden Android app to add new and auto-fill existing logins on the web and in other apps. There are two services which need to be enabled on Android to cover all Auto-fill scenarios, AUTO-FILL FRAMEWORK SERVICE and AUTO-FILL ACCESSIBILITY SERVICE. These services can be enabled from within the Bitwarden App under **{% icon fa-cog %} Settings**. When configured, you should see "Enabled" in green text. Double-check under the AUTO-FILL ACCESSIBILITY SERVICE that the Permission shows "Granted" in green text as well. 

Supported Versions:
1. The **Autofill Framework Service** for Android users on Oreo (8.0) and greater.
2. The **Auto-fill Accessibility Service** for all Android versions.

## Autofill Framework Service

{% note %}The Autofill Framework Service is only available to users on Android Oreo (8.0) and greater. If you are on a version of  Android prior to Oreo (8.0) you should only use the **Auto-fill Accessibility Service** as explained further down in this article. Otherwise, you should use both services for optimal functionality.{% endnote %}

1. Open the Bitwarden Android app.
2. Tap **{% icon fa-cog %} Settings**.
3. Tap **Auto-fill Service**. Status *Disabled* will appear in red.
4. Tap **Open Autofill Settings**.
5. Locate **Bitwarden** from the list and enable it.

The Autofill Framework Service is now enabled.

The Autofill Framework Service is context-sensitive and will appear whenever you encounter a form that can be auto-filled on your device. You can read more about the Autofill Framework service from [this posting on our blog](https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/the-oreo-autofill-framework){:target="_blank"}.

### Testing the Auto-fill Framework Service

2. View the login page for the app and focus the username or password field. A Bitwarden pop-up will appear below the input field.

### Troubleshooting the Auto-fill Accessibility Service

You will want to check the battery optimization settings on your phone and make sure it is turned off for Bitwarden. Often, Android Battery Optimization will turn off services to save battery and in turn kill the auto-fill services.

If you keep experiencing the AUTO-FILL ACCESSIBILITY SERVICE becoming disabled or not functioning as expected, check these settings in this order.
1. Double-check your Battery Optimization settings, you will want to make sure it is turned off for Bitwarden.
2. If you use a Battery Saver or Task Manager app then you may try to disable it to see if it makes any difference. If disabling the app makes a difference, add Bitwarden to the exception list.
3. Check the built-in Task Manager. You will need to bring up the running apps view and then hold down the app icon or swipe up on the Bitwarden app and then select Lock.

Please note, the service can also halt if you ever "Force stop" the Bitwarden app.

{% note %}
Android has many web browsers. It can be hard to keep up with them all. We have to add support for each browser individually. If auto-fill does not work and your browser is not listed above please report it at <https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/issues> so that we can add support.
