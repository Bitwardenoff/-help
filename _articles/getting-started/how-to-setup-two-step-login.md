Two-step login can only be configured from the [web vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com). If you lose access to your two-step verification app, and recovery code, bitwarden will not be able to recover your account.

1. Log in to the [web vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com) at https://vault.bitwarden.com
2. Click **Settings** on the sidebar 
3. Click **Manage Two-step Log in** under the **Two-step Log In** panel  
4. Type in your current password and click **Continue**
5. Follow the steps that appear
    1. Download two-step verification app
    2. Scan QR code
    3. Enter verification code
6. Click **Enable Two-step**
    - A green banner will appear above stating that two-step login has been enabled; and
    - **Important**: A brown banner will appear below with a recovery code
7. Print or write down the recovery code and store in a safe place
    - This code is **REQUIRED** to restore your account
8. Click **Close** and then **Log Out**
9. Log in to confirm that two-step verification is enabled and working
10. Log out of and back in to any other bitwarden applications that you are using
   - You will eventually be logged out automatically
