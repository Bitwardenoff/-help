MSPs, Resellers, and other Bitwarden Partners that are already administering Organizations on behalf of their clients can add pre-existing Organizations to their Provider Portal.

When Bitwarden detects that a [Provider Admin's]({{site.baseurl}}/article/provider-users/#provider-user-types) account is the **Owner of a non-Provider Organization**, the Provider Portal will display an **Add existing organization** button:

{% image /providers/add-existing-client-1.png %}

Selecting the **Add existing organization** button prompts you to select the Organization to add to the Provider:

{% image /providers/add-existing-client-2.png %}

Once added, the Organization will appear in the {% icon fa-bank %} **Clients** list alongside all other Client Organizations.
