Protect the contents of your Send by optionally configuring a [password for access](#passwords) so that no unintended recipients can see the contained information. For text Sends, you can also optionally require recipients to [toggle visibility](#hide-text) to prevent exposure to unintentional onlookers.

The **Password** and **Hide Text** options are configurable from the Create New Send view, or from the Edit Send views at any time prior to the Send's [deletion]({{site.baseurl}}/article/send-lifespan/#deletion-behavior).

## Passwords

For any Send, you may configure a password that recipients will be required to enter in order to access its contents. Password-protecting a Send is a good way to ensure the contents of a Send aren't exposed to unintended recipients:

## Hide Text

For text Sends, toggle the **When accessing the Send, hide the text by default** option to require recipients to {% icon fa-eye %} **Toggle Visibility** in order to see its contents. Hiding the text on a Send is a good way to ensure the contents of a Send aren't exposed to unintentional onlookers:
