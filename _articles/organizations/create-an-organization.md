This article will guide you through the process of creating an Organization. For more information about Organizations, see [About Organizations](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-organizations).

### Before You Begin

If you're a new user of Bitwarden, you'll need to create an account before you can create your Organization. Create your account for free [**here**](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/register){:target="\_blank"} or refer to [Create Your Bitwarden Account](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/create-bitwarden-account/) for help.

When you create an Organization, you will be assigned the User Type **Owner**. For more information, see [User Types and Access Control](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/user-types-access-control/).

## Create an Organization

3. On the New Organization screen, enter an **Organization Name** for your new Organization and the **Billing Email** we can reach you at.

    {% note %}Paid Organizations (Families, Teams, or Enterprise) have a 7 Day Free Trial built in. We won't charge you until your trial is over. You can cancel your subscription at any time in the **Settings** tab of your Organization.

4. If you're creating an Organization on behalf of a business:
   - Check the **This account is owned by a business** checkbox.
   - Provide your **Business Name**.

   Checking the **This account is owned by a business** checkbox will automatically filter your plan options to those suited to businesses. If you represent a business interested in testing secure sharing using a Free Organization, leave this option unchecked.
5. In the **Choose Your Plan** section, select which type of Organization to create. Options include:
