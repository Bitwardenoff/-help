## What are event logs?

Event logs are notes that contain time-stamped, detailed information about what occurs within an organization. These logs are often used to research changes in credentials or configuration, and are also helpful with troubleshooting.

## Where can I access event logs?

Inside the Web Vault  navigate to your Organization &#8594; Manage &#8594; Event logs.

You can search for up to 30 days of log events that scroll continuously.

To gather more data, plans with API access can use the [Bitwarden API](https://bitwarden.com/help/api/). API responses will contain the type of event (enums referenced below) and relevant data.

Example:
```
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "event",
      "type": 1000,
      "itemId": "3767a302-8208-4dc6-b842-030428a1cfad",
      "collectionId": "bce212a4-25f3-4888-8a0a-4c5736d851e0",
      "groupId": "f29a2515-91d2-4452-b49b-5e8040e6b0f4",
      "policyId": "f29a2515-91d2-4452-b49b-5e8040e6b0f4",
      "memberId": "e68b8629-85eb-4929-92c0-b84464976ba4",
      "actingUserId": "a2549f79-a71f-4eb9-9234-eb7247333f94",

    }
  ],
  "continuationToken": "string"
}
```

## SIEM and external system integrations

When exporting data from Bitwarden into other systems, a combination of data from the API and CLI may be used to gather data.

For example, Bitwarden RESTful APIs gather data around the structure of the organization.

- GET /public/members returns the Members,Ids, and assigned groupIds
- GET /public/groups returns all the Groups, Ids, assigned Collections, and their permissions
- GET /public/collections returns all Collections, and their assigned Groups

Once you have the unique ID for each member, group, and collection, you can now use the CLI tool to gather  information using the CLI command ```bw-list``` retrieve the following items in JSON format:

- Org Members
- Items
- Collections
- Groups

After gathering this data, you can join rows on their unique Ids to build a reference to all parts of your Bitwarden Organization.
