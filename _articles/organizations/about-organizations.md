## What are Organizations?

Organizations relate Bitwarden users together for secure sharing of Logins, Notes, Cards, and Identities. Creating an Organization opens an Organization Vault that exists alongside your Personal Vault. To share items in your Organization Vault, you can invite users to join your Organization.

Organization Vaults are organized into Collections, much like how Personal Vaults can be organized into Folders. Unlike your Personal Vault, items in the Organization Vault *must* be placed in a Collection and will be accessible by *anyone* who is allowed access to that Collection.

You can create an Organization by selecting the **New Organization** button. For help creating your Organization, see [Create an Organization](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/create-an-organization/).

Once you've created your Organization, invite users to start sharing. Invited users can open the Organization Vault at any time from the top-right **Organizations** card, or quickly access their assigned Collections from the left **Filters** card. For help inviting users to your Organization, see [Add or Remove Users](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/managing-users/).

## Types of Organizations

There are a few different types of Organizations available. When you create your Organization, you will be prompted to select one of the following options:

### Free Organizations
Free Organizations allow two users to securely share in up to two Collections. For more information about what features are included in a Free Organization, see [About Bitwarden Plans](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#free-organizations).

### Families Organizations
Families Organizations allow 6 users to securely share in unlimited Collections. For more information about what features are included in a Families Organization, see [About Bitwarden Plans](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#families-organizations).

### Teams Organizations
Teams Organizations allow unlimited users (*billed Per User Per Month*) to securely share in unlimited Collections and offer a suite of operational tools like Event Logs. For more information about what features are included in a Teams Organization, see [About Bitwarden Plans](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#teams-organizations).

### Enterprise Organizations
Enterprise Organizations allow unlimited users (*billed Per User Per Month*) to securely share in unlimited Collections and add enterprise-only features like Login with SSO to Bitwarden's suite of operational tools. For more information about what features are included in an Enterprise Organization, see [About Bitwarden Plans](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#enterprise-organizations).

## Organizations vs. Premium

**Organizations unlock access to secure sharing** between users who are members of that Organization.

Premium Individual plans unlock premium password security and management features, including advanced 2FA options, the Bitwarden Authenticator (TOTP), encrypted file storage, and more. **Premium Individual does not include secure data sharing.**

**Paid Organizations** (Families, Teams, or Enterprise) automatically include premium features (advanced 2FA options, Bitwarden Authenticator (TOTP), etc.) for every user enrolled in the Organization.
