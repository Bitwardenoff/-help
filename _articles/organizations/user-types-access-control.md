- Consumers of shared items in addition to their individual vault items
- Only work with items under collections they have been associated with
- Unable to create collections

### Manager

- Access and manage assigned collections in an organization
- Create new collections and modify the assigned collections 
- Able to set user access for assigned collections

### Admin 
- Access and manage all items, collections, and users in your organization
- Invite and confirm users to join an organization
- Manage Enterprise Policies
- Manage Groups
- View Event Logs
- Export organization vault data
- Normally only a few select Admins in an organization

### Owner 
- Highest level of access

{% note %}
Once the user or userâ€™s group is saved with their Collections access, the user will inherit those items into their Vault view.
{% endnote %}

## Access Control
In addition to defining the User Type, Access Control determines a full or partial view of the collections within an organization.

Choose **all items** or **selected collections** to set the appropriate access.

Choose **read only** for the appropriate collections.
